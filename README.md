## üß© Repository Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `HW1/` | Includes a Bash script for directory backups and logging, and a C++ module for matrix operations within the `algebra` namespace. Focuses on automation, scripting, and mathematical programming. |
| `HW2/` | A **banking system simulation** implemented in C++. Contains `Person`, `Account`, and `Bank` classes to handle transactions and demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance, and secure data management. |
| `HW3/` | Focuses on **Bloom Filters** and **Trie** data structures implemented in C++. Emphasizes efficient memory usage and search operations. |
| `HW4/` | A **messaging platform** project built in C++, utilizing **STL** and **OOP** principles such as classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Demonstrates STL algorithms and loop-free programming. |
| `HW5/` | Written in **Python**, this assignment explores **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **Decorators**, and **Asynchronous Programming**. It focuses on writing dynamic, concurrent, and modular code. |
| `HW_Bonus/` | A **JavaScript implementation of the Pig Game**, combining game logic, UI design (CSS), and event handling. Enhances understanding of front-end programming and interactive design. |
| `Project/` | Final project: **Quoridor Game** implemented in **C++**. Involves game mechanics, object-oriented design, and algorithmic pathfinding strategies. |
